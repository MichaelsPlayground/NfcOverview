# NFC Overview

This repository does not contain any code but gives an overview about the NFC projects I have set up.

Additionally a lot of information is given regarding the NFC technology and different kind of reading 
and writing NFC tags.

As all of the tags I'm supporting are widely available I collected a lot of material like datasheets and 
I'm providing them here for general use. If possible you should allway download the latest documents.
